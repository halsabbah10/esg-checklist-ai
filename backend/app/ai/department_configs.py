For each checklist item, assess completeness:
• Mark as 'Complete' if the answer is relevant, sufficiently detailed, and demonstrates understanding of ESG principles.
• Mark as 'Incomplete' if the answer is vague, lacks detail, or only partially addresses the ESG requirements.
• Mark as 'Missing' if no meaningful answer is provided.

For each 'Incomplete' or 'Missing' item, generate:
• Evidence Required: Specify what type of information, documentation, or specifics should be included for ESG compliance
• Gap Analysis: Explain why the answer falls short of ESG standards
• Next Steps: Provide clear, actionable improvements for better ESG compliance
