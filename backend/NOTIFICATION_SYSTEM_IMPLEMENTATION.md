# ESG Checklist AI - Automatic Notification System Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of an automatic notification system that sends in-app notifications to users when certain actions occur in the ESG checklist backend.

## Implementation Summary

### üõ†Ô∏è Components Created

#### 1. Notification Helper Module (`app/utils/notifications.py`)

**Purpose**: Centralized functions for creating and managing notifications.

**Functions implemented**:

- `notify_user()` - Generic function to send any notification to a user
- `notify_file_status_change()` - Specialized function for file approval/rejection notifications
- `notify_file_commented()` - Specialized function for new comment notifications

**Features**:

- Error handling with rollback on database failures
- Logging for debugging and monitoring
- Flexible notification types (info, success, error, warning)
- Optional link field for navigation

#### 2. Reviews Router Integration (`app/routers/reviews.py`)

**Enhanced endpoints**:

- `POST /reviews/{file_upload_id}/status` - Now sends notifications on status changes
- `POST /reviews/{file_upload_id}/comment` - Now sends notifications on new comments

**Features added**:

- Automatic notification when file status changes (approved/rejected/pending)
- Automatic notification when comments are added (only to file owner, not commenter)
- Reviewer name included in notifications
- Error handling that doesn't break main functionality

#### 3. Checklists Router Integration (`app/routers/checklists.py`)

**Enhanced endpoints**:

- `POST /checklists/{checklist_id}/upload` - Now sends success notification after upload

**Features added**:

- Success notification with AI score when file upload completes
- Link to uploaded file for easy access
- Error handling that doesn't interfere with upload process

### üìã Notification Types Implemented

| Trigger Event       | Notification Type | Title                         | Message Template                                                                              |
| ------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| File Upload Success | `success`         | "File Upload Successful ‚úÖ"   | "Your file '{filename}' has been uploaded and analyzed. AI Score: {score}/100"                |
| File Approved       | `success`         | "File Approved ‚úÖ"            | "Your file '{filename}' has been approved by {reviewer}"                                      |
| File Rejected       | `error`           | "File Rejected ‚ùå"            | "Your file '{filename}' has been rejected by {reviewer}. Please check comments for feedback." |
| File Under Review   | `info`            | "File Under Review ‚è≥"        | "Your file '{filename}' is now under review."                                                 |
| New Comment         | `info`            | "New Comment on Your File üí¨" | "Your file '{filename}' has received a new comment from {commenter}"                          |

### üîó Integration Points

#### Database Integration

- Uses existing `Notification` model with proper fields:
  - `user_id`: Target user for notification
  - `title`: Short notification title
  - `message`: Detailed notification message
  - `link`: Deep link to relevant resource (e.g., `/uploads/{file_id}`)
  - `type`: Notification type for UI styling
  - `created_at`: Timestamp (timezone-aware)
  - `read`: Read status boolean

#### API Integration

- Notifications accessible via existing `/notifications/my` endpoint
- Mark as read via `/notifications/read/{notification_id}` endpoint
- Admin can send custom notifications via `/notifications/send`

### üöÄ Usage Examples

#### Automatic Notifications (No Code Required)

Once implemented, notifications are sent automatically when:

1. **User uploads a file**: Gets success notification with AI score
2. **Admin approves a file**: File owner gets approval notification
3. **Admin rejects a file**: File owner gets rejection notification
4. **Reviewer adds comment**: File owner gets comment notification

#### Manual Notifications (Code)

```python
from app.utils.notifications import notify_user

# Send custom notification
notify_user(
    db=db,
    user_id=123,
    title="Custom Alert",
    message="This is a custom notification",
    link="/some-resource",
    notification_type="warning"
)
```

### üß™ Testing

#### Test Script Created: `test_notifications.py`

- Tests basic notification creation
- Tests file status change notifications
- Tests comment notifications
- Verifies database integration
- Checks import/integration status

#### Manual Testing Steps:

1. Upload a file ‚Üí Check for upload success notification
2. Change file status ‚Üí Check for approval/rejection notification
3. Add comment to file ‚Üí Check for comment notification
4. View notifications via `GET /notifications/my`

### üîß Configuration & Security

#### Error Handling

- All notification functions include try/catch blocks
- Database rollback on notification failures
- Logging for debugging without breaking main functionality
- Graceful degradation if notification system fails

#### Performance Considerations

- Notifications are created synchronously but quickly
- Database operations are minimal (single INSERT)
- No external API calls or heavy processing
- Indexed notification table for fast queries

#### Security Features

- User can only see their own notifications
- Notifications only sent to file owners (not reviewers commenting on their own files)
- All database queries use parameterized queries
- Role-based access for admin notification sending

### üì± Frontend Integration Ready

The notification system is designed to work seamlessly with frontend applications:

#### API Endpoints Available:

- `GET /notifications/my` - Get user's notifications
- `POST /notifications/{id}/read` - Mark notification as read
- `POST /notifications/send` - Admin: send custom notification

#### Notification Object Structure:

```json
{
  "id": 123,
  "title": "File Approved ‚úÖ",
  "message": "Your file 'report.pdf' has been approved by John Admin.",
  "link": "/uploads/456",
  "type": "success",
  "created_at": "2025-06-30T10:30:00Z",
  "read": false
}
```

### üöÄ Deployment Instructions

#### 1. Database Migration

The notification system uses the existing `Notification` model. Ensure database migrations are up to date:

```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

#### 2. Server Restart

Restart your FastAPI server to load the updated router code:

```bash
# Stop existing server, then:
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

#### 3. Verification

- Check Swagger UI at `/docs` for notification endpoints
- Test file upload ‚Üí should generate notification
- Test status change ‚Üí should generate notification
- Test adding comment ‚Üí should generate notification

### üéØ Future Enhancements

#### Potential Additions:

1. **Email Integration**: Send both in-app and email notifications
2. **Push Notifications**: For mobile/web app integration
3. **Notification Preferences**: User settings for notification types
4. **Batch Notifications**: Digest emails for multiple events
5. **Notification Templates**: Customizable message templates
6. **Advanced Filtering**: Notification categories and filtering

#### Analytics & Monitoring:

1. **Notification Metrics**: Track delivery rates and read rates
2. **User Engagement**: Monitor which notifications drive user actions
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Track notification creation performance

## ‚úÖ Implementation Complete

The automatic notification system is now fully implemented and ready for production use. Users will automatically receive relevant notifications for all file-related activities, improving the user experience and keeping everyone informed of important status changes.

### Next Steps:

1. Deploy the updated backend code
2. Test the notification system with real users
3. Monitor notification delivery and user engagement
4. Consider implementing frontend notification UI components
5. Collect user feedback for future improvements
